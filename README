Description

Requirements
============

VR ProtoShop requires Vrui version 13.0 build 001 or newer, and the Vrui
Collaboration Infrastructure version 10.2 or newer.

Installation Guide
==================

It is recommended to download or move the source packages for Vrui and
VR ProtoShop into a src directory underneath the user's home directory.
Otherwise, references to ~/src in the following instructions need to be
changed.

It is also recommended to skip optional steps 4 and 6 in the following
instructions. VR ProtoShop does not need to be installed in order to
be used; installation (to a system directory such as /usr/local) is
only recommended if VR ProtoShop will be used from multiple user
accounts.

0.1. Install Vrui from ~/src/Vrui-<version>-<build> (see Vrui README
     file).

0.2 Install the Vrui Collaboration Infrastructure from
    ~/src/CollaborationInfrastructure-<version>.

1. Change into ~/src directory and unpack the VR ProtoShop tarball:
   > cd ~/src
   > tar xfz <download path>/VRProtoShop-<version>.tar.gz
   - or -
   > tar xf <download path>/VRProtoShop-<version>.tar

2. Change into VR ProtoShop base directory:
   > cd VRProtoShop-<version>

3. If the Vrui version installed in step 0 was not 13.0, or Vrui's
   installation directory was changed from the default of /usr/local,
   adapt the makefile using a text editor. Change the value of
   VRUI_MAKEDIR close to the beginning of the file as follows:
   VRUI_MAKEDIR := <Vrui install dir>/share/make
   Where <Vrui install dir> is the installation directory chosen in
   step 0. Use $(HOME) to refer to the user's home directory instead
   of ~.

4. Optional: Adapt makefile if VR ProtoShop is to be installed in a
   different location, for example /usr/local. Set INSTALLDIR to the
   desired target location. VR ProtoShop will be then be installed in
   <INSTALLDIR>/bin, its configuration file will be installed in
   <INSTALLDIR>/etc, and its resources will be installed in
   <INSTALLDIR>/share/VRProtoShop (where <INSTALLDIR> is the value of
   INSTALLDIR set in the makefile).

5. Build VR ProtoShop:
   > make
   This creates the following executables in ./bin: VRProtoShop.

6. Optional: Install VR ProtoShop in the selected target location.
   This is only necessary if the INSTALLDIR variable in the makefile
   was changed. By default, VR ProtoShop can be run from its base
   directory. To install:
   > make install
   - or, if the target location is a system directory -
   > sudo make install
   This will copy all executables into <INSTALLDIR>/bin, the
   ProtoShop.cfg configuration file into <INSTALLDIR>/etc, and the
   resource files into <INSTALLDIR>/share/VRProtoShop.

7. Optional: Add directory containing the VR ProtoShop executables
   (~/src/VRProtoShop-<version>/bin in the default installation,
   <INSTALLDIR>/bin otherwise) to the user's search path. This allows
   running VR ProtoShop from any directory. Using csh or tcsh:
   > setenv PATH ${PATH}:~/src/VRProtoShop-<version>/bin
   - or -
   > setenv PATH ${PATH}:<INSTALLDIR>/bin
   where <INSTALLDIR> is the target location set in the makefile.
   Using bash:
   > export PATH=${PATH}:~/src/VRProtoShop-<version>/bin
   - or -
   > export PATH=${PATH}:<INSTALLDIR>/bin
   These lines can also be added to the user's .cshrc or .bashrc files
   to make the additions persist between logins.

Running VR ProtoShop
====================

These instructions assume that VR ProtoShop was installed in its base
directory, (see steps 4 and 6 above).

1. On MacOS X: Start X11. VR ProtoShop requires a running X server,
   but, if preferred, it can be started from a MacOS X terminal instead
   of xterm.

2. See Vrui's documentation on Vrui's basic user interface.

3. VR ProtoShop uses locator tools to select secondary protein
   structures for interaction or toggle coil regions for inverse
   kinematics updates. Locator tool behavior is selected via the
   interaction dialog.

4. VR ProtoShop uses dragging tools to drag selected secondary protein
   structures.
